# Ruby Capstone Project

> In this project, I will create a console app that will help you to keep a record of different types of things you won: books, music albums, movies, and games. Everything will be based on the UML class diagram presented below. The data will be stored in JSON files but I will also prepare a database with tables structure analogical to the program's class structure.
